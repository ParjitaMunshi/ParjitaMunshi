### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a data science student with a background in software development, I bring a unique perspective to the table. My passion for data science led me to pursue a Master's in the field, where I have gained hands-on experience with projects in data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling experience in building intuitive user interfaces has taught me the importance of designing data visualizations and dashboards that are both aesthetically pleasing and informative. Throughout my 1.5 years as a web developer, I honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which have proved invaluable in my career.

I'm passionate about using data to drive business decisions and am excited to continue learning and growing in this field. I am open to an opportunity that blends my enthusiasm for data science with my past experience in web development. I am eager to work on complex projects and collaborate with a team of talented individuals to create impactful solutions. With my background in UI development and growing knowledge in data science, I am ready to bring my unique perspective and skills to drive success in this field.
